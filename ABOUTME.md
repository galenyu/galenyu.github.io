# About Me
Growing up in Guangdong, China, I'm now a graduate at the Fudan University pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in Micro Nano Electronics Department. I didn't realize writing would become one of the most important part of my life until I began my journey in high school. Since then, I decided this was what I should be doing and haven't looked back since.

Committed to AI edge deployment, our lab and I hope to improve or even disrupt people's daily lives through technology, as well as build an AIoT world where everything is connected. My passion towards the software and the AI industry has made me want to head into internet or computer science upon my graduation.

In addition, I enjoy reading, cooking, going hiking, trying out and watching all kinds of sports. Life is really worth loving, which makes me try to do my best to open up my world to "work hard, play hard".

I'm always looking for challenges as well as different perspectives through which I can get a better understanding of the world. Please feel free to learn more about my work and don't hesitate to contact me if you are interested.
